# Job-Search-Web-Scrape
I wrote a script to scrape 2000 search results on Indeed.com and generate information visualization that answer the most commonly asked questions: What are the common keywords in the job description and in the job title?  What are the top 10 cities with the highest number of job openings?

You can check out the results without having to install anything on your computer: download the .ipynb file and run it on Google Collab (which is available on Google Drive).
